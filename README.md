# Data-Science-Certificate-Assignment-07

We will be walking through `wine-ratings.Rmd` in class as an example of linear regression and logistic regression. This was produced by David Robinson at `https://github.com/dgrtwo/data-screencasts`.


We will also be going through the `linear_regression.pdf` and `classification.pdf` files. These are taken directly from the materials associated with the *Elements of Statistical Learning* text by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani.
